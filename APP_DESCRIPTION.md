# LyricVideoAssetCreator (Concept)

**Current Status: Planning / Conceptual Phase**

**LyricVideoAssetCreator** is a planned productivity tool for music creators to generate high-quality visual assets for lyric videos. It is designed to automate the creation of background textures, typography layouts, and motion-ready layers.

### 🎯 Key Product Essence

The goal is to solve the bottleneck of creating assets for lyric videos. Instead of manually designing every frame in Photoshop, this tool would allow musicians to generate a coherent asset pack (backgrounds, text overlays, particles) that can be dragged into video editors like Premiere Pro or After Effects.

### 🛠️ Proposed Tech Stack

* **Framework**: React (Vite)
* **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas API for asset generation.
* **Export**: `JSZip` for bundling assets into downloadable packs.
* **Input**: Text parsing for lyrics to automatically generate per-line assets.

### ✨ Planned Features

* **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Generate abstract textures and gradients.
* **Tiered Exports**: Specific dimensions for YouTube (16:9), TikTok (9:16), and Instagram (1:1).
* **Layer Separation**: Export transparent PNGs for use in video editors.
* **Beat Matching (Future)**: Potentially import BPM to auto-suggest animation timing.
